# Object Detector with Distance Estimation

Welcome to the Object Detector with Distance Estimation project! This project utilizes computer vision techniques and the powerful YOLOv8 algorithm to detect various objects in real-time. Additionally, it provides distance estimation for specific objects, opening up exciting possibilities in a wide range of applications.

## Features
- Object detection: The system can accurately detect and classify 80 different objects, including people, vehicles, animals, and everyday items.
- Distance estimation: With advanced computation techniques, the project can estimate the distance between the camera and specific objects in the scene.
- Real-time performance: Enjoy real-time object detection and distance estimation, enabling seamless integration into applications that require real-time analysis.

## How it Works
1. The project leverages the YOLOv8 algorithm, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to identify objects in the input image or video stream.
2. After detecting objects, the system computes the distance between the camera and selected objects using computer vision techniques and geometric calculations.
3. The results are displayed in real-time, providing valuable information about the detected objects and their respective distances.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Download the pre-trained YOLOv8 weights and place them in the designated directory.
4. Run the object detection script, providing the input source (image or video) as an argument.
5. Explore the detected objects and the corresponding distance estimation results.
